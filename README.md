This Project is an Real Life Application of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Field. The main objective is to predict better predictions of Diabetic Result based on Patients' following attributes:
1. Pregnancies (number of times pregnant)
2. Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl)
3. Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg)
4. Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm)
5. Insulin (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml)
6. BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2)
7. Age (years)
8. Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestorâ€™s history')



























I've explored, analyzed the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, and applied Machine Learning Techniques.

The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the 8 attributes (TYNECKI, 2018): pregnancies, OGTT(Oral Glucose Tolerance Test), blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI(Body Mass Index), age, pedigree diabetes function. The Pima population has been under study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at intervals of 2 years since 1965. As epidemiological evidence indicates that T2DM results from interaction of genetic and environmental factors, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset includes information about attributes that could and should be related to the onset of diabetes and its future complications.
